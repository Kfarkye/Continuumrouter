# AI Email Templates in Chat - User Guide

## Overview

The AI in Continuum now has full access to your email template system. You can ask the AI to draft professional recruiter emails directly in chat conversations.

## How It Works

### 1. Template Knowledge

The AI knows about all 18 professional email templates:
- **Outreach emails** for prospects
- **Extension requests** for active assignments
- **Check-in messages** for mid-assignment touchpoints
- **Text message** formats for quick communication
- **Operations** emails for internal processes

### 2. Context-Aware Recommendations

When you're in a **clinician space**, the AI automatically knows:
- Clinician name and contact info
- Current facility and assignment dates
- Days remaining until end date
- Urgency level (critical/high/medium/on-track)
- Previous notes and preferences

### 3. Timeline-Based Suggestions

The AI recommends templates based on assignment timeline:
- **≤28 days**: Urgent extension request
- **29-42 days**: Standard extension request
- **43-56 days**: Mid-assignment check-in
- **57+ days**: General communication

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

Simply ask the AI to draft an email:

```
"Draft an extension email for Sarah"
```

```
"Write a check-in message"
```

```
"Create an outreach email for this prospect"
```

### Specific Template Requests

Request specific template types:

```
"Draft an urgent extension request"
```

```
"Write an initial outreach email with full pay details"
```

```
"Create a text message for quick follow-up"
```

### Customization Requests

Ask for specific customizations:

```

```

```
"Write a check-in that references their housing preference"
```

```
"Create an outreach email highlighting the signing bonus"
```

## Example Conversations

**AI:** Based on Sarah's assignment ending in 32 days, I'll create an extension request email:

---

**Subject:** Extension Opportunity at Stanford Medical Center

## Pro Tips

### 1. Open a Clinician Space First

For best results with active clinicians:
1. Click on their clinician space in the sidebar
2. The AI will automatically load their context
3. Ask for the email - it will be pre-filled with their data

### 2. Provide Missing Details

If the AI doesn't have all the details:

```
"Draft an outreach email for:
- Name: John Smith
- Facility: Mayo Clinic
- Location: Rochester, MN
- Pay: $3,200/week
- Start: Jan 15"
```

### 3. Request Variations

Ask for multiple versions:

```
"Draft 3 different subject lines for this extension email"
```

```
"Give me both a formal and casual version"
```

### 4. Iterate on Drafts

Refine the email in conversation:

```
"Make it more urgent"
"Add a sentence about the signing bonus"
"Shorten this to 3 paragraphs"
"Make the tone warmer"
```

## What the AI Can Do

✅ **Draft emails** using professional templates
✅ **Recommend templates** based on context
✅ **Customize content** for specific situations
✅ **Include timeline urgency** (URGENT labels for <28 days)
✅ **Reference clinician preferences** from notes
✅ **Format properly** (subject, greeting, body, signature)
✅ **Adapt tone** (formal, casual, urgent, friendly)
✅ **Create variations** (email vs text, short vs detailed)

## What Happens Next

1. **Review the draft** - Check all details are correct
2. **Copy the content** - Select and copy the email text

## Troubleshooting

**AI doesn't include clinician details:**
- Make sure you're in the clinician's space
- Try: "What do you know about this clinician?"
- Provide details manually if needed

**Email seems generic:**
- Add specific context: "Draft an email mentioning their preference for California"
- Reference their history: "Include that they extended last time"

**Wrong template recommended:**
- Request specific type: "Use the initial outreach template instead"
- Override suggestion: "I need an extension email, not check-in"

**Formatting issues:**
- Ask for reformatting: "Format this as a text message instead"
- Request structure changes: "Make this more concise"

## Best Practices

1. **Start conversations with context**
   - "I'm reaching out to Sarah about extending"
   - "This is for a new ICU prospect in Boston"

2. **Be specific about what you need**
   - "Draft an urgent extension email"
   - "Write a warm, friendly outreach"
   - "Create a professional check-in"

3. **Provide key details upfront**
   - Clinician name
   - Facility/location
   - Timeline/urgency
   - Special circumstances

4. **Iterate naturally**
   - "Make it shorter"
   - "Add more detail about benefits"
   - "Change the subject line"

5. **Use the AI as a collaborator**
   - "What template should I use here?"
   - "How should I approach this situation?"
   - "Is this too pushy?"

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Language Support
```

```

### A/B Testing Ideas

```

### Tone Adjustment
